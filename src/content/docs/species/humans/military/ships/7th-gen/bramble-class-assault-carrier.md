## Overview

The Bramble-class Assault Carrier is a human logistics and force-projection vessel designed to operate alongside Thorn-class Line Frigates. Its purpose is not to win battles directly, but to make human operations sustainable once contact has been made.

A Bramble functions primarily as an orbital sustainment platform. It carries ammunition, missiles, spare components, fuel, and replacement drones for Thorn formations, allowing prolonged combat operations without withdrawal. In addition to combat cargo, each vessel carries a limited complement of repair and material-harvesting drones. While insufficient for full reconstruction, these systems are capable of restoring most damaged ships to operational status after combat, provided they are not catastrophically destroyed.

The class also serves as a ground combat carrier. Depending on configuration, a Bramble may transport armored vehicles, combat automatons, aerial drones, and the dropships required to deploy them. Loadouts are modular. Some hulls are optimized for fleet sustainment, prioritizing missile and railgun ammunition and drone storage. Others sacrifice most fleet support capacity in favor of ground forces and deployment infrastructure. Mixed configurations are common.

Defensively, the Bramble is heavily protected but poorly armed for ship-to-ship combat. It mounts a single 320 mm railcannon with limited ammunition and is not intended to engage peer warships offensively. Instead, its survivability relies on strong full-coverage shielding, extremely thick hull armor, and a dense array of point-defense weapons. Large numbers of 50 mm flak cannons and multiple 150 mm cannons provide close-range coverage against fighters, missiles, and small craft. Accordingly, most onboard missiles are fragmentation or high-explosive types intended for defensive saturation rather than capital ship kills. It also excels at precise orbital bombardment with the aid of its scouting drones and sensor buoys.

Against a single enemy frigate, a Bramble is unlikely to secure a kill. However, it is equally unlikely to be destroyed. An attacking ship of equivalent class will typically exhaust its available munitions long before the Bramble's shields and armor are breached.

The class is not designed for planetary landing. It remains in orbit throughout operations, deploying all forces via dropships and drones.

The naming convention is deliberate and continues through many older 7th generation ships.

## Loadout Examples

### Ground Assault Configuration

**Focus:** Planetary conquest, sustained deployment

- Tanks: ~400–450
- APCs / IFVs: ~350–400
- Combat automatons: ~18,000
- Aerial drones: ~1,200
- Dropships: ~30
- Missiles: ~500 (mostly HE / frag)
- Railgun ammo: ~3,000 rounds

Used when orbital control is secured and ground resistance is expected to be prolonged.

### Fleet Sustainment Configuration

**Focus:** Supporting Thorn formations

- Missiles: ~3,000–4,000
- Railgun ammo: ~5,000 rounds
- 150 mm ammo: ~400,000 rounds

Most common configuration. Balanced for flexibility and endurance.

## Cargo

Retrofitted to carry cargo across dangerous stretches of space. Due to its slow acceleration instead of stopping to unload cargo it will open its huge hangar doors and drop the containers it carries. Not unlike a bomber would bombs.
