title: 'Rose-Class Strategic Command Vessel'
description: 'Humanity"s strategic command ship housing the irreplaceable SCAI, focused on theater coordination and absolute stealth.'

## Overview

The Rose-class is humanity's sole true flagship. It does not engage in combat.

Its function is strategic oversight, sensor fusion, and coordination across all deployed forces in a theater of operations. The vessel is irreplaceable due to its onboard AI.

Each Rose houses a single Strategic Command Artificial Intelligence (SCAI). This system is the product of centuries of iterative training on historical and real-time combat data. Its neural architecture is unique and non-reproducible; attempts at duplication have resulted in catastrophic cognitive failure or strategic incompetence. The SCAI's computational capacity is such that, without the bandwidth limitations imposed by stealth, it could directly control every automated unit in a theater—micromanaging individual infantry automaton footfalls, ship thruster burns, and missile terminal guidance—in real time, for multiple theaters simultaneously. In practice, it issues only high-order commands to preserve stealth and network security.

A noted tactical anomaly noted by non-humans is that the otherwise low-cost human drones and ships possess communication and sensor suites far superior to their peer counterparts. It's actually become a common joke that the humans spent their whole budget on the sensor and communications suite. Leading to the rest of their ships being incredibly cheap.

In reality this is a direct result of the SCAI's design: every unit is a sensor node and data relay. The SCAI learns and refines its predictive models from this constant, distributed feed of battlefield data. The more units in the field, the more comprehensive its awareness and the more effective its command becomes.

The vessel is crewed by 8–12 human specialists in strategy, cognitive systems monitoring, and intelligence analysis. They are supervisors, advisors, and custodians of the SCAI. Their primary function is to provide strategic context, ethical boundaries, and to monitor the SCAI for behavioral anomalies. Persistent, unconfirmed speculation among intelligence circles suggests the SCAI may have achieved emergent sapience, a theory the human military neither confirms nor denies.

The ships main and so far infallible defence mechanism is stealth. Unlike the Bramble-class and Thorn-clas—which merely run cold by design—this is a true stealth ship. It can't be spotted by any known sensor equipment other than visually seeing it with cameras. At any practical distance it's completely invisible. Despite this, further safety precautions are taken and the vessel usually loiters anywhere between a few light seconds to a light minute from combat.

Loss of a Rose is classified as a strategically unacceptable outcome. The sacrifice of entire fleets, planets, or campaigns is considered acceptable to prevent its capture or destruction.

**Role:** Theater command / strategic intelligence / coordination hub

**Doctrine:** Centralized cognition, decentralized execution, absolute survivability

**Operational Use:** Remote oversight of all human operations in a designated theater

## General Characteristics

**Length:** ~85 m  
**Beam:** ~16 m  
**Height:** ~12 m

**Mass:**
- Dry: ~14,000 t
- Operational: ~18,000 t

**Crew:** 8–12  
**AI:** One (1) Strategic Command Artificial Intelligence (SCAI)

## Power & Propulsion

**Reactor:** Two high-output, pulsed-fusion cores (redundant, normally idle).  
**Energy Storage:** Lattice-based supercapacitor bank (primary weapon and propulsion reserve).  
**Main Drive:** Quadruple clustered fusion torch array with magnetic nozzle steering.  
**Thrust:** ~240 MN (burst), ~60 MN (sustainable)  
**Acceleration:**
- Burst (0-30 min): ~13.3 m/s² (~1.36 g)
- Sustainable (post-burst): ~3.3 m/s² (~0.34 g)  
**Delta-v:** Effectively unlimited via reactor mass consumption; acceleration limited by crew endurance and thermal management.  
**Evasion Capability:** Acceleration profile is sufficient to outrun most known long-range kinetic projectiles and missile systems by maintaining constant evasion burns.

## Defense Systems

**Armor:** Lightweight composite; survival is based on evasion and stealth, not durability.  
**Shields:** Classified  
**Stealth / Emission Control:** Classified

## Armament

**Primary Weapon:**  
Classified… access granted.  
1× 580 mm Extended-Range Kinetic Projector (ERKP-580) *Law's Left Hand*

**Projectile Specs:**
- Diameter: 580 mm
- Length: 2.5 m
- Mass: 20 t
- Composition: Depleted uranium-tungsten composite.
- Muzzle velocity: 120,000 km/s (0.4 c)

**Kinetic Yield:**  
Energy on impact: ≈38,000 megatons=38 gigatons

On contact, both projectile and target material are converted into high-energy plasma. Known shielding systems are defeated through instantaneous energy flux saturation (too much oomph at once).

Effective engagement range is measured in astronomical units and is limited primarily by targeting accuracy.

### Distance to Impact Time

| Distance | Time to Impact |
|----------|----------------|
| 100,000 km | 0.83 s |
| 1 million km | 8.3 s |
| 10 million km | 83 s (~1.4 min) |
| 100 million km | 14 min |
| 1 AU (150 million km) | ~21 min |

**System Limitations:**
- Firing consumes ~92% of the ship's stored energy.
- Capacitor recharge to full combat readiness requires 8-14 weeks of minimal operation.
- Launch generates an unambiguous Cherenkov radiation signature and broadband EM pulse detectable across multiple solar systems.
- Doctrine: For self-preservation only. Use signifies a catastrophic failure of stealth and strategy.

## Networking & Command

**AI System (SCAI):** A quantum-annealing neural network. Trained on the entirety of recorded human conflict and continuous live data. Its processing capacity is the reason even simple human drones have excellent sensors and comms—they are its eyes, ears, and voice.

**Theoretical Direct Control Capacity:** Could simultaneously provide real-time, micro-second control for over 10 million individual combat units (ships, drones, automatons) in a single theater without performance degradation.

**Practical Command Method:** To maintain stealth, the SCAI issues objective-based command packets (e.g., "Secure Sector Delta-7, expect enemy ambush at point Charlie, acceptable loss rate: under 40%"). These are routed through a multi-hop relay of Thorn frigates, sensor buoys, or disposable comms drones. Subordinate AIs (like those on Brambles or in ground formations) then execute the intent.

## Design Philosophy

The Rose-class turns the entire theater of operations into a unified, constantly learning organism. Its staggering computational power is why human forces appear adaptive and coordinated despite their expendable, low-tech platforms. Its existence is the core of human tactical supremacy; its location is their most closely guarded secret. It is much more than a warship. It is the reason wars are won before the first shot is fired.

## Outside Perspective

The number of Rose-class ships in service is unknown.

It is a popular belief that the Rose-class is a propaganda tool. The only times it has been spotted is in long range photographs, which are often dismissed as fake due to the usually much more reliable long range sensors reporting back nothing.

A single Rose-class is also shown off during the biyearly military parade hosted at the human home planet. It is believed to be fake. A paper tiger.
