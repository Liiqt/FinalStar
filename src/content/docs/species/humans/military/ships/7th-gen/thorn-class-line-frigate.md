title: 'Thorn Class Line Frigate'
description: 'Human expendable frigate designed for ambush tactics, missile saturation, and low-signature operations in decaying star systems.'

## Overview
The human Thorn class line frigate is not an impressive ship to look at. At roughly one hundred and twenty meters in length, narrow-beamed and sharp-nosed, it lacks the mass, glow, and theatrical presence most species associate with warships. It looks like a pencil, and that is intentional.

Designed around automation rather than habitation, the frigate carries only four to eight humans when crewed at all. There are no spacious decks, no recreational sections, and no constant life-support hum. When uncrewed—which is common—the ship is effectively hollow, its internal volume dominated by magazines, drone bays, heat sinks, and redundant machinery. This absence of biological load allows the vessel to operate cold. Very cold.

In passive mode, the frigate can shut down nearly all active systems, bleeding heat into internal sinks and shadowed radiators over long periods of time. With shields offline, no beam weapons charged, and only passive sensors running, its thermal and electromagnetic signature is scarcely distinguishable from surrounding debris. When drifting near asteroids or wreckage, it is often mistaken for exactly that: inert matter. Stealth is not its purpose, but it is an unavoidable consequence of human design choices.

Its power plant is optimized for long idling, extended lifespan, and efficiency, in exchange for a comparatively very low power output. The ship relies on an extensive power-storage system that recharges over long periods to perform at peak efficiency. Despite how this sounds, it is not a very exploited weakness, as these ships often idle for months at a time and are frequently the ones tasked with doing the ambushing.

When the frigate does fight, it does so briefly and decisively. Its primary armament consists of two heavy 320 mm railguns firing dense kinetic slugs, used sparingly to avoid prolonged heat buildup. These are supplemented by a vertical launch system holding roughly five hundred missiles—the ship's true killing power. Most carry conventional anti-ship, fragmentation, or thermobaric warheads, but the ship also typically carries no more than forty nuclear warheads. These nuclear warheads are tactical in nature, intended for ship killing, radiation flooding, or electronic annihilation rather than sheer destruction. Humans have more expensive hydrogen bombs for that. Their yields are measured in a few megatons and they are often used as smokescreens or show-starters, frequently being the first and last missiles fired in an engagement.

Point defense is strictly utilitarian. Kinetic CIWS and limited short-burst lasers are used only when necessary. There is no reliance on continuous energy projection, no glowing shields, and no persistent emissions. In fact, most of these frigates do not have any installed shields due to them being deemed redundant and too expensive. The frigate survives by being difficult to notice and difficult to justify targeting—until it is already firing.

This leads to it often leaving the battle damaged, but it is exceptionally hard to kill, due to it being an automated ship with many redundant systems. Poking huge holes in its hull will only disable the systems directly hit. Leading to it becoming infamously frustrating to fully destroy.

In battle, Thorn frigates rarely act alone. They operate in small, dispersed cells, slaved through encrypted networks to distant command ships far from the engagement zone. Most of the vessels an enemy sees are unmanned or lightly crewed, their human commanders watching and directing the fight from safety. Losing a frigate is always acceptable.

The Thorn line frigate is not built to dominate space through presence. It exists to wait, to endure, and to strike once the opportunity presents itself, unleashing its missile-dominated firepower.

## Conclusion

500 Missiles.

But, no really. It's a shitbox with no shields, almost no life support. A terrible powerplant. Very slow movement. It's just a hidden and slightly defended missile and gun platform that moves. It can fire all of its missiles through its 24 tubes in 315 seconds or 5 minutes and 15 seconds. It can fire all of its railgun rounds in 40 minutes. It is not a combat sustainable platform. It will take down ships much more expensive than itself in no time at all, but it won't win a prolonged fight. Combine 4 of them though and you have a real 'fuck you' to any small group of ships. Which you can do as it's cheap as dirt and fast to make, due to all of its compromises.
