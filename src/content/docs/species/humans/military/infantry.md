title: 'Human Ground Infantry Doctrine'
description: 'Human infantry composed of autonomous units with indistinguishable human commanders, evolving through multiple generations of development.'
---

Human ground infantry formations are composed almost entirely of autonomous combat units directed by a central battlefield AI, typically located aboard nearby ships or within hardened command bunkers. Actual human soldiers are present in very small numbers, embedded directly within these formations. They are not visually distinguished from the automatons they command.

This was not originally a tactical decision, but a logistical one. Early doctrine mandated a single standardized set of powered armor and equipment for all ground combatants. Automatons were built to match the armor's dimensions rather than the reverse, drastically simplifying production, maintenance, and replacement. Human soldiers initially resisted the change, citing a noticeable drop in comfort and overall gear quality compared to their original bespoke equipment. The logistical advantages, however, proved decisive.

Human soldiers operate inside powered exoskeletons that carry their own weight and significantly augment physical ability. Automatons do not wear armor; instead, they are constructed with the powered armor as their structural base and outer shell. As the doctrine evolved, later generations deliberately preserved and refined this configuration. Height, mass, silhouette, surface materials, thermal output, and movement capabilities are intentionally matched. Under battlefield conditions—visual observation, sensor analysis, or combat telemetry—there is no reliable method to differentiate a human from a ninth-generation automaton.

By the fifth generation, this indistinguishability had become the foundation of the doctrine rather than a side effect. With every soldier appearing identical, enemy forces find it nearly impossible to identify priority targets. Actual human casualties are correspondingly rare. Enemy morale suffers as they are forced to fight what appears to be an endless mass of inexpensive machines, while knowing that any one of them could, in fact, be a human commander. Human morale benefits from the inverse reality: losses are overwhelmingly material rather than personal.

Because humans and automatons look the same, behavior becomes the primary remaining vector for target discrimination. Early generations failed in this regard, though not in the way later doctrine might suggest.

First-generation infantry automatons were crude, rigid, and tactically unsophisticated, frequently compared in after-action reports to early household droid systems. Movement was stiff, reactions were delayed or inappropriate, and decision-making relied on narrow rule sets. These units were often less effective than human infantry and were widely regarded as a waste of resources and a general failure.

Rather than abandoning the automaton-centric approach, human forces treated this as a training problem. Subsequent generations incorporated large-scale machine learning systems trained directly on human combat data. The Central Battlefield Command Artificial Intelligence (CBC-AI) learned how humans moved, took cover, reacted under stress, coordinated with allies, and deviated from optimal behavior when necessary. As automaton behavior became more human-like, combat effectiveness increased accordingly.

This shift produced an additional benefit. As automaton behavior converged toward human norms, embedded human soldiers became less distinguishable.

Later generations refined this further through adaptive behavioral modeling. Automatons were no longer trained solely on generalized human datasets, but on the specific behavior of their assigned commanders. Over time, entire formations developed a unified behavioral signature.

This led to human commanders forming attachments to their assigned automaton forces. Some began painting units in distinctive colors or adding markings and decorations to personify their formations. This practice was initially forbidden, as it was believed to undermine the tactical advantage of visual uniformity. Field data demonstrated the opposite; a slight increase in combat effectiveness and soldier morale.

Over time, certain formations became recognizable to the enemy as coherent threats, echoing older human traditions such as legion standards and heraldry. Even so, the majority of automatons remain in factory coloration, as most are not trained on a specific commander's behavioral dataset.

By the ninth generation, this approach was fully realized.

In ninth-generation formations, approximately one human is deployed for every five thousand automatons. Each human functions at the equivalent of a regimental commander. Rather than issuing direct tactical commands, they act as an over-commander. A dedicated personal combat AI integrated into the human's exoskeleton interfaces with both the human and the central battlefield AI, translating intent into executable directives and controlling the automatons under its span.

When a human commander is present, nearby automatons gradually synchronize their behavior to that individual. The formation adopts the commander's movement patterns, combat rhythm, and decision tendencies. When no human is present, behavioral constraints are lifted and automatons revert to factory behavior.

From an opposing force's perspective, every infantry unit appears identical and behaves plausibly human. Every target may be leadership. Destroying infantry does not degrade coordination. Eliminating command is impossible without total annihilation. Human ground forces are not designed to be elite. They are designed to be not worth fighting.

## Generation Information

1st gen, 3rd gen, 5th gen and 8th gen in that order. All generations are still technically in service even if only the 8th and 5th gen are currently being produced.

The 5th gen is still being produced as it's actually a side grade to the 8th gen that was previously too expensive to mass produce. With the advancements in production and material science it became a viable platform. Some say the design was ahead of its time.
