## SIZE STANDARD
*Kinetic‑Counterforce Particle Shields (Reference threats: GAR‑320, H‑GAR‑800)*

### S1 — Light Shield Generator
- **Use:** Corvettes, small auxiliaries, debris protection
- **Power draw:** 15 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~1×10¹¹ J
- **Particle output:** ~50 kg/s at ~40 km/s
- **Behavior:**
  - Provides minimal protection against small debris and low-energy PD
  - Offers no resistance to capital-grade weapons
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~1,440% of capacity. Shield is instantly vaporized.

### S2 — Frigate Shield Generator
- **Use:** Frigates, light combatants
- **Power draw:** 50 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~5×10¹¹ J
- **Particle output:** ~150 kg/s at ~60 km/s
- **Behavior:**
  - Can absorb multiple minor impacts
  - Cannot meaningfully oppose capital-grade weapons
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~288% of capacity. Catastrophic overload; immediate collapse, ship has a chance to survive.

### S3 — Destroyer Shield Generator
- **Use:** Destroyers, heavy escorts
- **Power draw:** 200 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~2.5×10¹² J
- **Particle output:** ~400 kg/s at ~100 km/s
- **Behavior:**
  - First class capable of meaningful interaction with GAR or capital-grade weapons
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~57.6% of capacity. Shield overloads and collapses. Some projectile energy reaches hull, ship survives.

### S4 — Cruiser Shield Generator
- **Use:** Cruisers, major combatants
- **Power draw:** 600 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~1×10¹³ J
- **Particle output:** ~1,200 kg/s at ~150 km/s
- **Behavior:**
  - Can stop GAR‑320 hits
  - Rapid depletion under sustained fire
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~14.4% of capacity. Shield survives with heavy drain (~65%). 2–3 direct hits before failure.

### S5 — Battleship Shield Generator (H‑GAR THRESHOLD)
- **Use:** Battleships, superheavy line combatants
- **Power draw:** 3,500 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~4×10¹⁵ J
- **Particle output:** ~6,500 kg/s at ~260 km/s
- **Behavior:**
  - First shield class capable of surviving a single H‑GAR‑800 hit
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~3.6% of capacity. Easily absorbs GAR‑320 volleys.
- **Interaction with H‑GAR‑800:** Impact is ~90% of capacity. Projectile stopped.

### S6 — Orbital / Fortress Shield Generator
- **Use:** Orbital platforms, hardened planetary defenses
- **Power draw:** 7,500 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~1.2×10¹⁶ J
- **Particle output:** ~18,000 kg/s at ~320 km/s
- **Behavior:** Designed for repeated high-energy kinetic interception. Recharge rate and heat are its main limiters.
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~1.2% of capacity. Projectile fully absorbed; minimal drain.
- **Interaction with H‑GAR‑800:** Impact is ~30% of capacity. Projectile stopped; ~40–50% reserve drain. Can absorb 2–3 hits in quick succession before failure.

### S7 — Strategic Shield Generator
- **Use:** Strategic assets, megastructures, system-level installations
- **Power draw:** 18,000 MW
- **Single-hit capacity:** ~5×10¹⁶ J
- **Particle output:** ~60,000 kg/s at ~420 km/s
- **Behavior:** Engineered to resist sustained heavy bombardment.
- **Interaction with GAR‑320:** Impact is ~0.3% of capacity. Projectile absorbed with negligible drain.
- **Interaction with H‑GAR‑800:** Impact is ~7% of capacity. Projectile stopped with minimal instability. Requires sustained siege or multiple weapons to force failure.

## TLDR:

- **S1–S2:** Incapable of stopping capital-grade projectiles
- **S3:** Overloaded by GAR‑320 but ship underneath survives
- **S4:** Can hold against GAR‑320, but limited by recharge and reserve
- **S5:** Survives one H‑GAR‑800 hit; GAR‑320 easily absorbed
- **S6:** Survives multiple H‑GAR‑800 hits; limited by recharge cycles
- **S7:** Survives sustained H‑GAR‑800 barrages; strategic defense level
