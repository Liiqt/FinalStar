## SIZE STANDARD

*All outputs are continuous electrical power, not peak as they can be overloaded.*

### S1 — Light Ship Reactor
- **Use:** Thorn-class, corvettes, small auxiliaries
- **Electrical output:** 30–60 MW
- **Typical:** 40 MW
- **Energy production:** 108–216 GJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 10–100 TJ

### S2 — Medium Ship Reactor
- **Use:** Bramble-class, light carriers, fleet support ships
- **Electrical output:** 100–200 MW
- **Typical:** 120 MW
- **Energy production:** 360–720 GJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 200–500 TJ

### S3 — Line Destroyer Reactor
- **Use:** Line destroyer, heavy escorts
- **Electrical output:** 400–800 MW
- **Typical:** 600 MW
- **Energy production:** 1.4–2.9 TJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 1–3 PJ
- **Design traits:**
  - First class able to meaningfully support heavy guns
  - Can recharge GAR-class weapon energy requirement in hours, not days
  - Heat becomes the main constraint, not energy storage

### S4 — Capital Ship Reactor
- **Use:** Cruisers, battleships, major combatants
- **Electrical output:** 1–3 GW
- **Typical:** 2 GW
- **Energy production:** 3.6–10.8 TJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 5–20 PJ
- **Design traits:**
  - Multiple independent reactor blocks
  - Large cooling systems
  - Weapons limited by heat and barrel wear, not power

### S5 — Supercapital Reactor
- **Use:** Huge ships, flagships, ground bases
- **Electrical output:** 5–10 GW
- **Typical:** 7 GW
- **Energy production:** 18–36 TJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 30–100 PJ
- **Design traits:**
  - City-scale power grid
  - Can fire H-GAR repeatedly before depletion
  - Cooling system is huge and vulnerable
  - Continuous operation for decades

### S6 — Orbital / Station Reactor
- **Use:** Space stations, orbital defense platforms, ground forts
- **Electrical output:** 10–25 GW
- **Typical:** 15 GW
- **Energy production:** 36–90 TJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 100–500 PJ
- **Design traits:**
  - Massive
  - Continuous operation for centuries
  - Can support planetary shields, grids, or multiple H-GARs

### S7 — Megastructure Reactor
- **Use:** Rare, system-level assets
- **Electrical output:** 30–100 GW
- **Typical:** 50 GW
- **Energy production:** 108–360 TJ/hour
- **Storage supported:** 1–5 EJ
- **Design traits:** Not practically mobile
