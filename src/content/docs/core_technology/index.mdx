## Gravity-Assisted Inertial Decoupling (GAID)

During acceleration, local gravity fields suppress inertial coupling between mass and spacetime.

- Rest mass is unchanged.
- Effective inertial mass is reduced by a fixed ratio inside the acceleration volume only.
- Momentum conservation is satisfied through the gravity field.
- On field exit, inertia returns to normal instantly.
- Failure of this system destroys the weapon or the ship.
